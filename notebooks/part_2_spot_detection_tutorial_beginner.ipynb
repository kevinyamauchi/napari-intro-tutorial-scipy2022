    "In this activity, we will perform spot detection on some in situ sequencing data ([Feldman and Singh et al., Cell, 2019](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(19)31067-0s)). In doing so, we will combine methods from [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/), and [cellpose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose). The goal is to familiarize you with performing analysis that integrates the scientific python ecosystem and napari.\n",

To test out your function, vary the detection parameters and see how they affect the results. Note that each time you run the cell, the new results are added as an addition Points layer, allowing you to compare results from different parameters. To make it easier to compare results, you can try modifying the layer opacity or toggling the visibility with the \"eye\" icon in the layer list."
